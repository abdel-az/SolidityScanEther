"# SolidityScanEther" 

Project Overview

This project is designed to analyze and detect vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts using Artificial Intelligence. The application consists of two main components:

Frontend: Developed using React.js

Backend: Built with Django

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for uploading and reviewing smart contract code, while the backend processes the code and applies AI-based vulnerability detection models.

How to Run the Web Application

To run the application locally, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Start the backend (Django):

Install the required dependencies.

Run the Django server using the appropriate command (e.g., python manage.py runserver).

Start the frontend (React.js):
