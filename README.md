This project is designed to analyze and detect vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts using Artificial Intelligence. The application consists of two main components:

    - Frontend: Developed using React.js

    -  Backend: Built with Django

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for uploading and reviewing smart contract code, while the backend processes the code and applies AI-based vulnerability detection models.

I- How to Run the Web Application

To run the application locally, please follow these steps:

 1 - Clone the repository to your local machine.

 2 - Start the backend (Django):

    - Install the required dependencies using requirement.txt with command (pip install -r requirement.txt).

    - Run the Django server using the appropriate command (e.g., python manage.py runserver).

3 - Start the frontend (React.js):

    - Navigate to the frontend directory.

    - Install required npm packages.

    - Start the development server (e.g., npm start).

Once both servers are running, open the provided local URL in your browser to access the application.
